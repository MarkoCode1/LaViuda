# LaViuda
## Description:
La Viuda is the mexican verison of Whiskey Poker where 2 or more players try to get the best poker hand. In between the players on the table are 5 cards faced down, the first player can either decide to switch their entire hand with the faced down cards or skip and let the next player decied. If smeone switches their hand, their cards end up on the table and the next person can choose to either swap one card or the entire hand to try to get the best hand. A round ends when someone knocks on the table and each person must show whatever hand they have and the end of that round. Each player gets 3 lives and the table gets one life, whoever loses all three lives first gets the tables life. The game keeps going till someone loses all their lives. 

### Purpose:
A fun game that the user can play against another person.

Th picture above shows a rought outline of my projoct in what I hope it would look like (Only a lot better). As you can see the top of the page shows the tables hand and below that will be the players and the buttons they can interact with. Those buttons are (From left to right) Switch (Allows a player to switch one card with a tables card, Swap (Allows a player to swap their entire hand for the table hand, Skip Turn (Self Explanatory), and Knock (Ends the round for every player). When a player hits the skip button the cars will switch over to the next player and show their cards. 

# Week 2: 
So far I have added the code I have written in my repository under La Viuda folder. I didn't have a lot of time to write code and a lot of it is a mess right now but I plan on refining it soon.

Created several classes (I may or may not keep all of them)
Wrote code and some tests 

# Week 3:
I was able to refine my code and clean it up quite a bit, I feel I have a better grasp at what I am trying to accomplish, I do have some running code and test cases but no GUI code yet, I plane on hopefully starting that next week. I did create my GUI wireframe in what I hope my code will look like. I most likely than not will make changes between now and the end of the project but this is what I envsion now. 

Below shows my GUI wireframe, it depicts a table showing the player(s) hands and the tables hand, the skip button changes from player 1 to player 2.

# Week 4: 
Below is my Requirements Traceability Matrix for what I have worked on so far and when I need to work on in the near future. This week hasn't been too productive as I mainly focused on how to do GUI work in prperation for next week. I was able to work some GUI components within my code and create new code to check and compare poker hands and I was able to get get the code to check up to a 3 of a kind.
